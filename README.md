# Cornerstone-Sem-2-Arduino

I curate the Arduino and corresponding C++ game for the Despicable Me themed sharp shooter carnival game my group and I are designing for our Cornerstone of Engineering 2 class

I program and set up the circuit board design for the Arduino component of our project, which primarily composed of a conveyor-belt-like design that moves the targets back and forth for the players to aim at. I used a combination of the gear motors, wheels, switches and additionally circuitry, as well as a for-loop code to do so. 

While the Arduino component is my primary responsibility, I also aid in the physical construction of the game and work closely with the construction specialist, using my knowledge of Maker-space's hand tools and design, as the physical design plays a huge role in how successful the Arduino component is.
